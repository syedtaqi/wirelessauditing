# Wireless Auditing
A collection of customed automated wireless auditing scripts.

This repo was made to automate the collection and recovery of WPA2-PSK EAPOL handshakes broadcast over the 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi channels using various methods. 

The functions use and require the aircrack-ng suite of tools, and is to be used for educational purpose and pursuets.

These scripts are tested in a wireless lab and have proven effective when launched from debian based distros.

To set up your own wireless lab you will require a linux machine running debian linux, 2 wics (1 capable of monitoring),
1 wireless ap and you should be able to set it up in such a way that 1 wic connects to the ap while the other captures the EAPOL.

The author is not liable for any unauthorized access or breach of secure networks as a result of using these scripts or any form of damages sought after. The user accepts causation of any action preformed by any script authorized by this repo.
